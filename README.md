lead scoring of possible leads that may convert to paying customers

X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. The company also gets leads through past referrals.
X Education wants to pursue the most promising leads that will turn into paying customers.
Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%.
Although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor.

We have built a logistic regression model in python 3.9.13 which can be executed using the lead dataset.
